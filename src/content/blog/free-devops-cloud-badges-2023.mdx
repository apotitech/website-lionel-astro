**Welcome to the world of DevOps and Cloud Computing!**

To keep ahead in this competitive environment, you must constantly enhance your abilities and demonstrate your knowledge with certificates and badges.

**Once you get these certifications, and your resume will look a whole lot better.**

Completing these credentials not only distinguishes you from the crowd. You will also obtain knowledge and comprehension of the following cutting-edge technologies:

*Rather, it is the difference between an educated person who stops learning and one who continually attempts to widen their perspectives through learning.*
